        <strong>Here's about Steve Jobs's jobs:</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In 1996, Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million.
            The deal was finalized in February 1997,[135] bringing Jobs back to
            the company.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in
            July 1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in
            September.[136]
          </li>
          <li>
            In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's efforts on returning to
            profitability, Jobs terminated a number of projects, such as Newton,
            Cyberdog, and OpenDoc.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of
            encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, "afraid that they
            might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that
            Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was
            enough to terrorize a whole company."[137]
          </li>
          <li>
            Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it
            too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found
            its way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved
            into Mac OS X. Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales
            significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new
            products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have
            worked well for Apple.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim"
            modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[138] Jobs
            quipped at the time that he would be using the title "iCEO".[139]
          </li>
          <li>
            The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving
            upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the iPod
            portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes
            Store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music
            distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            On June 29, 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the
            introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which
            also included the features of an iPod and, with its own mobile
            browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing
            open-ended innovation, Jobs also reminded his employees that "real
            artists ship".[140]
          </li>
          <li>
            Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell,
            starting in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell for making
            "un-innovative beige boxes".[141]
          </li>
          <li>
            On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked what
            he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he
            said: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the
            shareholders."[142] Then, in 2006, Jobs sent an email to all
            employees when Apple's market capitalization rose above Dell's:

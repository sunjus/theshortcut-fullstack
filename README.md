# Theshortcut-Full Stack Development Training Program
consisted of 360 hours and covered : JavaScript, CSS, Git, HTML, ReactJS, NodeJS.
I have successfully completed The Shortcut's Full Stack Development Training Program.
It was super exciting journey.
I'm happy to see myself how much I grew as a competent developer since the first session of the training.
